It's tough to know where to start! I'm a fan of all things computers and have always loved creating things. I studied electronic music production at university and graduated with a first Bachelor of Arts (Honours) where I created all sorts of unique audio projects. In my free time I program game mods in Java and enjoy creating advanced gameplay areas in the Source 2 engines. 

Because of the diversity of my interests, you can easily filter my projects by tag which should allow you to find what you might be interested in.
