    title: "Turning Radiation into Music"
    excerpt: "Using a Geiger counter, a Raspberry Pi and a host computer and DAW, I created ambient generative music that played in real-time.
		<br> <br> The Raspberry Pi contained some code that would read its GPIO pins (where the Geiger counter was connected to) and send a packet to another computer on the same network. This computer would then generate a random MIDI note from a selection for each packet, and send it to FL Studio via a virtual MIDI cable for driving audio plugins.
		<br> <br> The audio file here contains 20 minutes of arbitrarily-recorded audio."

    title: "Random Glitch and Audiovisual Composition"
    excerpt: "Inspired by Ryoji Ikeda, I set up a system in FL Studio that would apply various glitch effects randomly using MIDI, and created visuals that would be synced automatically to them using ZGameEditor Visualizer."

I've been creating audio, mainly music, since I started messing around with FL Studio aged 13 or so. My skills were enough to study Electronic Music Production at university (without prior formal education in music) and my creativity and capability of making innovative compositions has only increased since then.
